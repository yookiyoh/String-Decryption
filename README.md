# String-Decryption
OOP CMPE 103 Lab Exercise 1

# Problem 2: Decryption

Write a Python Script that will accept a string as encrypted text and then the program will decrypt it using the following character substitute:

'a' = *, 'e' = & , 'i' = # , 'o' = + 'u' = !

See sample output:

Enter a string to decrypt: th& q!#ck br+wn f+x j!mps +v&r th& l*zy d+g.

The Plain Text:  the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
